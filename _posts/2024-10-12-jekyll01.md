Here is a list of several options of graphs to use in mermaid

## Flowchart

```
graph TD
    A[Requirements] --> B[Design]
    B --> C[Implementation]
    C --> D[Testing]
    D --> E[Deployment]
    E --> F[Maintenance]
    F --> A
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] --> B[Design]
    B --> C[Implementation]
    C --> D[Testing]
    D --> E[Deployment]
    E --> F[Maintenance]
    F --> A
```

## State Diagram

```

    direction LR
    [*] --> Requirements
    Requirements --> Design
    Design --> Implementation
    Implementation --> Testing
    Testing --> Deployment
    Deployment --> Maintenance
    Maintenance --> [*]
```

```mermaid

    direction LR
    [*] --> Requirements
    Requirements --> Design
    Design --> Implementation
    Implementation --> Testing
    Testing --> Deployment
    Deployment --> Maintenance
    Maintenance --> [*]
```

## Grantt Chart
