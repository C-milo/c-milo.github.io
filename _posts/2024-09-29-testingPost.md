# This is a single line test

Use the `print()` function to display output in Python. This is very pretty.

# This is an example with Python

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

# Below an example with javascript

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

# Now with golang

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

# Now with Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```


# With Ruby

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

# And finally with Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```

# This is a new section

This is the explanation that I didn't know I needed to have something something

```python
import something

print("Hellow something")
```
