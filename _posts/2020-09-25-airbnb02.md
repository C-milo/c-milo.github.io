## Image Recognition 

First, I started configuring an azure cognitive services API. From it I got a subscription key and an endpoint to connect. More can be found in [azure-doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python-analyze).


```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import json


#subscription key and endpoint
subscription_key = ''
endpoint = 'https://sdm-airbnb-images.cognitiveservices.azure.com/'
analyze_url = endpoint + "vision/v2.1/analyze"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params = {'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color'}
```


```python
# This part of the code is just for testing and understanding 
# of the response from the Azure API.

data = {'url': 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/67002727-38d2-4be7-aa2d-3beabc29df91.jpg?aki_policy=large'}

response = requests.post(analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()
analysis = response.json()

image_description = analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"]
image_dominantfgColor = analysis["color"]["dominantColorForeground"]
image_dominantbgColor = analysis["color"]["dominantColorBackground"]

print(image_description)
print(image_dominantfgColor)
print(image_dominantbgColor)
```

### Azure ComputerVisio API Response and storage
Now that I have a better understanding of what I can find in each response from the API I can collect and append this data to my **airbnb_listing.csv** dataset.

Azure Computer Vision can extract information from any image and retrieves, identifying colors, objects, words, faces and more!

See [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/#features) a few examples of how powerful this tool can be. In this case I'm using it for something very simple.


```python
image_desc = []
image_fgColor = []
image_bgColor = []

# Looping in airbnb_listing.csv 

for image_url in airbnb_df['picture_url']:
    # Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.    
    data = {'url': image_url}
    
    response = requests.post(analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()
    analysis = response.json()
    #print(json.dumps(response.json()))
    
    try:
        image_desc.append(analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"])
        image_fgColor.append(analysis["color"]["dominantColorForeground"])
        image_bgColor.append(analysis["color"]["dominantColorBackground"])
    except:
        print('Error image_url: ' +image_url)
        continue
```

    Error image_url: https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/aac2258d-f866-466b-92ac-4acbc5399391.jpg?aki_policy=large



```python
airbnb_df['image_description'] = image_desc
airbnb_df['image_dominantfgColor'] = image_fgColor
airbnb_df['image_dominantbgColor'] = image_bgColor
airbnb_df.head(5)
# len(image_desc)
```




    551




```python
airbnb_df.to_csv ('airbnb_listing_imagereco.csv', index = None, header=True)
```

At this point the image recognition process is now complete. It is time to proceed with the sentiment analysis part. 

## Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob

This library is very simple and easy to use for obtaining a quick sentiment analysis, however it is not always very accurate. More on that later. 


```python
import csv
from textblob import TextBlob
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)
df = pd.read_csv("airbnb_reviews.csv")
```

The code is all based on the quickstart guide from the official [documentation](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html) of the library.


```python
Polarity = []
Sentiment = []
# Categorizing sentiment
for row in df['comments']:
    feeds = TextBlob(row)
    polarity = feeds.sentiment.polarity
    if(feeds.sentiment.polarity > 0.5):
        sentiment = "Positve"
    elif(feeds.sentiment.polarity < 0.5):
        sentiment = "Negative"
    else:
        sentiment = "Neutral"
# Add data to list
    Polarity.append(polarity)
    Sentiment.append(sentiment)
# Append data to DF
df['Polarity'] = Polarity
df['Sentiment'] = Sentiment
# Export to csv
df.to_csv('airbnb_reviews_sentiment.csv',index=False, encoding = 'utf-8')
```

### Why I say it is not very accurate ?
TextBlob will score a word from -1 to 1, being -1 the most negative and +1 the most positive.


```python
print(TextBlob("Great location, gorgeous apartment!").sentiment)
```

    Sentiment(polarity=0.8375, subjectivity=0.825)


For many reviews, mostly the ones that had no ambiguity in its words, the score can be quite accurate however that's not always the case.


```python
print(TextBlob("You will not be disappointed, go ahead and book!").sentiment)
```

    Sentiment(polarity=-0.9375, subjectivity=0.75)


It is a good a review, however TextBlob polarity is **-0.9375**. That is due to the way this library works which basically uses a dictionary of words, amplifiers, modifiers, negations among other fancy terms that added together give a score to the whole sentence and finally a polarity.

More details about this can be found in this [post](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/). from planspace.org. 

Despite this I will continue with the next part and use this data anyways. (In a newer version I might improve this.. maybe? )

We are now ready to start the analysis!.
