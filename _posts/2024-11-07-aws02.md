## AWS S3

- Automatically creates and stores copies of all S3 objects.
- Wide range of storage classes. For frequently access data, to less frequent or long term data archive. 

### Use cases

- Websites
- Mobile Apps
- Enterprise Apps
- Backups/Restore
- Archive
- IoT Devices
- Big Data Analytics

## AWS EC2

EC2 Instance Types:

General Purpose:
  : CPU, memory and network (e.g Web Servers)

Compute Optimized
  : CPU Utilization (e.g Game Servers)

Memory Optimized
  : Large Data Sets (e.g Big Data Analytics)

Storage Optimized
  : Sequential read and Write access (e.g Data warehousing)

Accelerated Computing
  : Machine/Deep learning

HPC Optimized
  : High-performance processors (e.g. Complex simulations)

### Notes on EC2

Unlimited Mode:
  : 
  - Unlimited mode is enabled by default on T2 and T3 instances. 
  - The purpose of this mode is to burst beyond their baseline performance when required, even if they've exhausted their CPU credits. 
  - While it can lead to higher costs, it prevents performance degradation during unexpected spikes in demand.

## EBS Volumes types

General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3):
  : 
  - gp2: Balances price and performance
  - gp3: Newer, more flexible, and can be more cost-effective
  - Use for: Boot volumes, dev/test environments, and low-latency interactive apps

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2):
  : 
  - Highest performance SSD volumes
  - io2 offers more durability and IOPS per GB than io1
  - Use for: I/O-intensive workloads like large databases

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):
  : 
  - Low-cost HDD volume
  - Optimized for throughput-intensive workloads
  - Use for: Big data, data warehouses, log processing

Cold HDD (sc1):
  : 
  - Lowest cost HDD volume
  - For less frequently accessed workloads
  - Use for: Colder data requiring fewer scans per day

### Key Differences:

- Performance: SSDs (gp2, gp3, io1, io2) offer higher IOPS and lower latency than HDDs (st1, sc1)
- Cost: HDDs are cheaper for storage, SSDs for performance
- Use cases: SSDs for transactional workloads, HDDs for throughput-oriented big data workloads
- Flexibility: gp3 and io2 offer more customization in performance characteristics

## EBS Multi-Attach

- This is a feature that allows to attach a single EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. It is only compatible with IOPS SSD (io2 and io2).
- Can attach to up to 16 nitro-based EC2 instances in the same AZ.
- Requires a cluster-aware file system (GFS2, OCFS2)
- IOPS limits are shared among attached instances
- Use Cases include, high-availability clustered databases, distributes systems etc. 

## Amazon VPC

- CIDR Classless Inter-Domain Routing: The allowd CIDR is between /16 to /28
  - 10.0.0.0/16 = 65,531 IP addresses available + 5 AWS reserved = Total of 65,536 IP addresses
- NACL or Network Access Control List: This is the firewall of a subnet. 
  - They are stateless and require explicit rules to be defined. 
  - A Default NACL allows inboud/outbound traffic by default.
  - A Custom NACL denies inbound/outbound traffic by default.
  - Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule representing the highest priority, to determine whether traffic is allowed or not. 
- Security Groups are a Virtual Firewall at the instance level
  - By default it denies all inbound and allows all outbound traffic.
  - Security groups are stateful, all responses to inbound traffic are automatically allowed. 
  - All rules are evaluated.
