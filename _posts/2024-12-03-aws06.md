## AWS Lambda

To use AWS lambda:

1. Upload your code to AWS lambda
2. Set up your code to trigger from other AWS services, HTTP endpoints, in-app activity, or run on a schedule. 
3. Lambda is invoked

## Notes on AWS Lambda

- Lambda can be invoked directly using; Lambda API, AWS SDK, AWS CLI, AWS Toolkit
- Lambda can also be configured to read events from a queue or a stream such as DynamoDB Amazon SQS, or Amazon Kinesis. This is known as poll-based invocation, where lambda functions are triggered periodically a data source or service for new events or data.

## Invocation Methods

- Lambda can have `Synchronous invocation` used by services like:
  - Amazon API Gateway 
  - Amazon Alexa 
  - Elastic Load Balancer
  - AWS Step Function
  - Amazon Cognito

Example:

```sh
aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name MyFunction \
    --payload '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}' \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    output.txt
```
This command:

1. Invokes the function named "MyFunction"
2. Sends a JSON payload with two key-value pairs
3. Specifies the input format
4. Saves the response to output.txt
 

- Lambda can have `Asynchronous invocation` used by services like:
  - S3
  - Amazon Simple Email
  - AWS CloudWatch
  - AWS CFN
  - Amazon SNS
  - AWS Config
  - AWS IoT Events

```sh
aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name MyFunction \
    --payload '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}' \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --invocation-type Event \
    output.txt
```

This command is similar to the synchronous version, but:

    It includes --invocation-type Event to specify asynchronous invocation
    The CLI will return immediately, not waiting for the function to complete

In both cases, you can check the contents of output.txt to see the function's response (for synchronous invocation) or the status of the invocation request (for asynchronous invocation).

## Practice Lab

- Use Python to create an AWS Lambda function.
- Deploy the Lambda Function
- Testing the function

### 1. Writing the Python Function

```python
# Please review the comments for each code block to help you understand the execution of this Lambda function.
# At the time you create a Lambda function, you specify a handler, 
# which is a function in your code, that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes your code.
# The Lambda handler is the first function that executes in your code.
# Python programming model - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-programming-model.html
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    # context – AWS Lambda uses this parameter to provide runtime information to your handler.
    # event – AWS Lambda uses this parameter to pass in event data to the handler. This parameter is usually of the Python dict type.
    # AWS Lambda function Python handler - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-handler.html
    
    # When you invoke your Lambda function you can determine the content and structure of the event. 
    # When an AWS service invokes your function, the event structure varies by service.
    # 
    # In this lab, the lambda_handler "event" parameter has the following structure of name/value pairs:
    # {
    #     "emoji_type": number,
    #     "message": "string"
    # }
        
    # In a name-value pair you can extract the "value" of the pair using the "name" of the pair.   
    # Here the id value is extracted from the event Lambda parameter and passed to a variable called emoji_type.
    emoji_type = event["emoji_type"]
    # Here the message value is extracted from the event Lambda parameter and passed to a variable called message.
    message = event["message"]
    
    # The variables are printed here, which means the variable values will be displayed in CloudWatch logs and the Execution Results panel.
    print(emoji_type)
    print(message)
    
    # In Python, you can create a variable with no value using the Built-in constant None. This means the variable "custom_message" currently has no value.
    feeling = None
    
    # In Python, we use the if-elif-else to create a conditional execution. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement
    # That is, if the value of emoji_type is equal to 0, we execute the statement inside its block
    if emoji_type == 0:
        # Only execute if id is equal to 0
        # The variable custom_message combines "Message for code 0:" string with the variable message
        feeling = "positive"

    elif emoji_type == 1:
        # The variable custom_message combines "Message for code 1:" string with the variable message
        feeling = "neutral"

    else:
        # The variable custom_message combines "Message for all other codes:" string with the variable message
        feeling = "negative"
        
    # Optionally, the handler can return a value. What happens to the returned value depends on the invocation type you use when invoking the Lambda function
    # In this lab we use synchronous execution, so we need to create a response for the lambda function.
    # We created a "response" variable that has a structure of name-value pairs using the id and custom_message created earlier.
    response = {
        # In this name-value pair, the literal value "message" will store the value of the variable custom_message.
        "feeling": feeling,
        # In this name-value pair, the literal value "id" will store the value of the variable id.
        "message": message,
    }
    
    # Finally, we return the values from response variable to the caller, which could be a test event or an AWS service performing a synchronous call.
    # The execution of the lambda function is finished.
    return response
```
