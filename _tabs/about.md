Born and raised in the city of Bogota, Colombia. I moved to Canada to study Big Data Analytics in 2019. Before that I had a few years of working experience as a Linux system administrator and as an Implementation Engineer. In that latter position is where I had a glimpse on how important and powerful data is for a company to make decisions and optimize its resources. Thus, giving it a boost over its competitors.

At the begging of my career in IT I was very interested in all sort of ways to automate tasks, so I learned how to write scripts in Python and Bash to do to the dirty job for me. I hate working on repetitive, non-creative stuff !. I also had the opportunity to learn about networking and infrastructure later on. 

After, I took a few online courses on DevOps, which I found fascinating for its nature of automating processes and all its open source tools that helped achieve that goal. Other courses where oriented on Big Data and the many concepts associated to it like, Python, Data Visualization, no-SQL etc. 

In conclusion, I have many experiences and knowledge I've learned on my last 7 years  (at the time of writing this post) of experience  working in IT, but I'm not an expert on anything. I am only a devoted guy, that is driven by constant curiosity to technology.
